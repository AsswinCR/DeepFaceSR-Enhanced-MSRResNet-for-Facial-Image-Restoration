Details for Testing the Solution:\
And For Training:\
        1. Make sure all the file paths are correct according to paths in your machine.\
        2. Once that is set ensure your cluster setup is correct.\
        3. In the terminal type and run:\
                    `sbatch run.sh`\
And For Testing:\
        1. Use the trained model weights, ensure the file paths are correct according to paths in your machine.\
        2. In the terminal run:\
                    `sbatch test.sh`}
